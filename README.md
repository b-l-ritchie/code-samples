Sample scripts

Scripts included are part of a personal project that aims to identify stock price trends based on underlying changes in EPS estimates.
The scraping information is used to create a performance scorecard to measure how companies are performing versus estimates. The earnings calendar is useful to see when companies will report results which is also the time EPS estimates see the greatest revisions.
Some files will contain notes I've jotted down while working on the project for ideas to improve or revisit.
